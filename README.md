This is set of console applications.   
Currently write for [python](python), [c#](csharp), [c++](cpp), [javascript](js).   
All code written and run under [Visual Studio Code]() (with required compilers and extensions) in Windows 10.

## Time of execution
Measure bubble sort for array with 10000 elements.
